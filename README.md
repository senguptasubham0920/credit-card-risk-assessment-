# credit-card-risk-assessment
Given certain features the financial organisation wants to get well informed about their customer behaviors so that they can strategize their policy well enough for the next five years. 
The dataset is a well well known Kaggle Competition Dataset for risk management.
The main idea of the project is to apply Explanatory Data Analysis on the given dataset to draw useful insights and hence apply these insights to design simple classification models to assess the risk associated with each customer while providing credit card facilities.  
Here three machine learning algorithms are applied Decision Tree, non linear SVM, and Random Forest. And appropriate model metrics are then compared for all the three models.
